# Work Scheduler

## Description
Work days are hectic; emails, messages, systems, phone calls, meetings, and so much more. How do you keep track of everything? Some use spreadsheets and others use yet another calendar system. What if you only need a calendar for today? 

This project is a daily calendar where you can keep track of your schedule without maintaining a giant database you call a calendar. As Michael Scott said in the office, 'K.I.S.S - Keep it simple stupid!'. Great advice, hurts every time.

What I learned creating this project is how quick and easy it is to use bootstrap to create dynamic webpage layouts and saving key/value pairs to local storage for quick and easy access to saved data.

## Installation
